# One-shot build of EVERYTHING: the macOS app + both in-process agents, then launch it.
# The Android agent (.so + dexes) and the iOS-Simulator agent are now built by build.sh
# itself (the agent is part of the product), so this script just adds the optional
# companion APK + install/launch convenience. A missing Android toolchain makes the
# build FAIL (the app would be incomplete) — pass --no-agent to opt out on purpose.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/all.sh                 # build app + agents (Debug), then launch
#   ./scripts/all.sh --release       # optimized build
#   ./scripts/all.sh --install       # build Release + copy into /Applications + launch
#   ./scripts/all.sh --no-agent      # build the app WITHOUT the in-process Android agent
#   ./scripts/all.sh --no-run        # build only, don't launch
