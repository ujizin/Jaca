# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Jaca is a non-sandboxed SwiftUI macOS app (developer tools): device log streaming, network capture (in-process Android agent, MITM proxy, and an on-device **companion app** — Compose Multiplatform under `mobile/` — that captures per-app traffic and streams it over gRPC/TLS for desktop-side decryption), and local maintenance areas (Projects — auto-detected Claude projects + their worktrees + user-added folders, with per-checkout cache cleanup; Gradle daemons; Xcode DerivedData). See `README.md` for the product/network-capture deep dive.

## Build, run, test

The Xcode project is **not committed** — it's generated from `project.yml` by XcodeGen. Source files are globbed from `Sources/` (and `Tests/`, `UITests/`), so **adding a file needs no `project.yml` change** — just regenerate. `Jaca.xcodeproj/` is gitignored.

```bash
./scripts/run.sh            # generate + build (Debug) + launch
./scripts/build.sh [Release]# build only (re-signs with the dev identity if set up)
./scripts/gen.sh            # regenerate Jaca.xcodeproj from project.yml
./scripts/uitest.sh         # XCUITest suite (kills stray instances first)
./scripts/all.sh [--release|--install|--no-agent|--no-run]  # agent + app + launch
./scripts/dev-signing.sh    # one-time: stable code-signing so the Keychain CA prompt stops
./scripts/build-mobile.sh   # build the companion APK + bundle it into Resources/
./scripts/proto-gen.sh      # regenerate gRPC stubs from proto/companion.proto
./scripts/install-cli.sh    # link `jaca` (the daemon CLI) onto PATH; `all.sh --install` runs it
```

The scripts set `DEVELOPER_DIR` to Xcode (needed when `xcode-select` points at the CLT). To run **one test** (scripts don't expose this), invoke xcodebuild directly:

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild \
  -project Jaca.xcodeproj -scheme Jaca -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES \
  -only-testing:JacaTests/ClaudeProjectGroupingTests/test_group_nestsWorktreesUnderTheirParentRepo test
```

If `defaults read dev.srsouza.Jaca daemonAreas` is set on the machine, add
`TEST_RUNNER_JACA_DAEMON_AREAS=none` in front of `xcodebuild … test`: the tests are hosted by the
app, which otherwise connects to the real `~/.jaca/jacad.sock` and replaces a running daemon that
is older than the build under test.

`JacaTests` includes **live** tests (`LiveAndroidTests`, `LiveSimulatorTests`, `LiveAgentCaptureTests`) that need a real device/emulator/agent and **fail** when absent — skip them with `-skip-testing:JacaTests/LiveAgentCaptureTests` etc. when verifying logic locally.

### Building from a `.claude/worktrees/` worktree

`project.yml` declares Lemonade as `path: ../lemonade-design-system`, resolved from the repo root. That works from the main checkout but **not** from a worktree two levels down — XcodeGen fails with *"Invalid local package Lemonade"*. To build in-worktree, symlink it first, then remove it after (the built `.app` is self-contained; the link is only needed at build time):

```bash
ln -sf "$HOME/workspace/lemonade-design-system" "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/../lemonade-design-system"
```

(If a `clean` removes it, just re-create the symlink — it's only needed at build time.)

### Stable code-signing (stops the recurring Keychain prompt)

The MITM CA private key lives in the macOS Keychain, and macOS binds a key's "Always Allow" to the requesting app's code signature. Ad-hoc debug builds (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"`) get a new signature every rebuild, so the CA-key prompt returns on each launch. Run `./scripts/dev-signing.sh` **once** to create a stable self-signed `Jaca Dev` identity in a dedicated keychain (authorize the single trust prompt — codesign refuses an untrusted identity); `build.sh` then re-signs the app with it via `dev-resign.sh`, so one "Always Allow" sticks across rebuilds. Optional — without it the build stays ad-hoc.

### The companion mobile app (`mobile/`)

A Compose Multiplatform app (`mobile/composeApp`, package `dev.srsouza.jaca`) that captures on-device traffic with a `VpnService` + a userspace TCP/IP stack (zdtun JNI, `androidMain/jni/`) and streams per-app flow metadata to the desktop over **gRPC + TLS** (contract: `proto/companion.proto`; phone = server, desktop = client). TLS is decrypted on the **desktop** — the CA private key never reaches the phone; the phone tunnels intercepted TLS to the desktop's MITM proxy. The gRPC server runs from app open (`CompanionServer`) so the desktop can push its CA (`InstallCa`) and the app guides the user to install it before any capture. `./scripts/build-mobile.sh` assembles + bundles the APK (needs the NDK/CMake in the README table); the desktop serves it for QR onboarding and reads its commit hash for update detection.

Full end-to-end flow + sequence/state diagrams: **`docs/companion-architecture.md`** — keep it current when the flow or the wire protocol changes.

## Architecture

Three layers, enforced by directory:

- **`Sources/Core/`** — no SwiftUI. Device discovery, log sources, SQLite history, the proxy, the agent controller, and the per-area services (git, Gradle, DerivedData, Claude scanning). New backends slot in behind small protocols (`DeviceProvider`, `LogSource`).
- **`Sources/Model/`** — `@Observable @MainActor` state. `AppModel` owns the device list, open tabs, and one model instance per top-level area. Session types (`LogSession`, `NetworkSession`) conform to `WorkspaceTab`.
- **`Sources/Features/`** — SwiftUI views, one folder per feature.

### The daemon (`jacad`, experimental — branch `exp/daemon`)

`Sources/Core` also compiles into a second target, `jacad` (`Sources/Daemon/main.swift`, embedded at
`Jaca.app/Contents/MacOS/jacad`): a background daemon serving each area over newline-delimited
JSON-RPC on `~/.jaca/jacad.sock` (`Sources/Core/Daemon/`). Areas are opt-in per area
(`defaults write dev.srsouza.Jaca daemonAreas -array …`, or `JACA_DAEMON_AREAS=all`); off, the app
works in-process exactly as before. Domain logic lives in Core engines (`ProjectsEngine`,
`DevicesEngine`, `LogStreamEngine`, `CloudEngine`, `CloudStreamEngine`, `NetworkCaptureEngine`)
that the app runs in-process or mirrors from the daemon (`Model/Daemon/`). Because `jacad` builds
Core without Model/Features, Core must never reference them. Plan, decisions and status:
**`docs/daemon-plan.md`**. The Herdr plugin client is `herdr-plugin/`.

`jacad` is also the **`jaca`** command line (`Sources/Core/CLI/`): run through a symlink named
`jaca` it takes subcommands (`jaca net requests --failed`, `jaca overrides add --from …`) over the
same socket. Its table columns are the JSON field names; any other text it prints needs copy from
a ticket. The agent workflow is `.claude/skills/jaca-cli/`.

### The top-level "area" pattern

The left sidebar switches the main pane between **areas** via `AppModel.mode: WorkspaceMode` (`devices`, `projects`, `gradle`, `xcode`). Adding an area means touching a consistent set of files — read one existing area end-to-end (e.g. Projects or Xcode) before adding one:

1. A case in `enum WorkspaceMode` (in `AppModel.swift`) + a model instance `let foo = FooModel()` on `AppModel`.
2. A `Core/<Area>/` service (does the filesystem/process/git work, off the main actor).
3. A `Model/FooModel.swift` (`@Observable @MainActor`) holding view state and calling the service.
4. `Features/<Area>/` — a sidebar header (`onTapGesture { model.mode = .foo }`, styled like the others) and an area view.
5. Wire both into `App/RootView.swift`: add the header to the sidebar `VStack` and a branch to the `detail` switch.

Long-running work (logcat, the proxy) accumulates off the main thread and flushes into the observed model on a timer so a chatty device doesn't stutter the UI. Network capture picks **agent vs proxy** per tab (`NetworkSession`); the in-process Android agent lives under `agent/` (built separately — see README).

## Conventions

- **Design system:** build UI from Lemonade — `LemonadeUi.*` components, `LemonadeTheme.colors.*` / `LemonadeTypography.shared.*` semantic tokens, `GroveIcon(glyph:)`. Don't hardcode colors/fonts; match the tokens used in neighboring views.
- **Animate state changes:** the app aims for a polished, fluid feel — every meaningful UI state change should animate, not snap. Expand/collapse, list inserts/removes, tag/size updates, refresh indicators, hover affordances, and view-mode switches should use `withAnimation`/`.animation(_:value:)` and `.transition(...)`. Follow the established style: short `.easeInOut` (~0.15–0.3s), rows fade+slide on insert/remove (e.g. `.opacity` while `removing`, green flash on a freed size), chevrons rotate on expand. When adding UI, add the matching animation by default — keep it subtle and consistent with neighboring views rather than flashy.
- **Testability:** factor pure logic out of services/models into free functions/enums and unit-test those (e.g. `WorktreePorcelainParser`, `ProjectsGrouping`, `LogcatParser`) rather than testing through the UI.
- **Non-sandboxed by design** so the app can `Process`-spawn `adb`/`xcrun`/`git` — don't add the App Sandbox entitlement.

## Reactive-first & caching (IMPORTANT)

Areas must feel **instant**. A screen that has shown data before must **never flash empty** while it recomputes — opening it, switching away and back, or relaunching the app should all render immediately from the last known result. This is a first-class requirement, not a nice-to-have.

The pattern (reference implementation: `ProjectsModel` + `ProjectsCache`):

1. **Persist the last result to disk** (`Codable` → `~/Library/Caches/Jaca/…`), including expensive derived data like `du` sizes, on every successful scan.
2. **Load the cache synchronously in the model's `init`**, so the first frame already has data.
3. **Block only the cold first scan** (no cache to show); afterwards refresh in the **background** while the cached data stays interactive, behind a subtle "Refreshing…" indicator.
4. **Gate auto-refresh on a staleness TTL** (don't rescan on every `onAppear`) so re-entering a screen within a session is free; keep an explicit refresh control, and where it helps, a `FolderWatcher` to refresh automatically when the underlying directories change.
5. **Compute slow per-item work (e.g. `du`) in the background**, patching rows as results land, so a list with many items stays responsive instead of blocking.

When adding or revisiting an area whose data comes from the filesystem/processes (Gradle daemons and Xcode DerivedData currently rescan on appear), prefer this cache-first, background-refresh shape over scan-on-open.

## Persisted caches must be migration-safe — NEVER lose data (IMPORTANT)

Adding a field to a persisted `Codable` model must **never** drop the user's existing data. Caches live across releases (`~/.jaca/…`, `~/Library/Caches/Jaca/…`, `UserDefaults`), so a schema change that fails to decode silently wipes them. **Every time you add or change a persisted model, do the migration — there is no "small enough" change that skips this.**

The trap: Swift's **synthesized `Codable` ignores a property's default value for missing keys**. Add a non-optional field and decoding the old JSON throws `keyNotFound`; a `try? decode(…) ?? []` then returns empty, and the next save overwrites the file with that empty value — the user's data is gone. (This actually happened: adding `CloudProject.favoriteLabelKeysByLogName` emptied `~/.jaca/cloud-logging/projects.json`.)

So, for every model written to disk/`UserDefaults`:

1. **Tolerant decode.** Give it a custom `init(from:)` (in an `extension`, so the memberwise init is preserved) that uses `decodeIfPresent(_:forKey:) ?? default` for every field except the truly-required ones (e.g. an id/key). Missing keys → defaults; unknown future keys are ignored automatically. Do this for nested/embedded models too (they decode as part of the parent).
2. **Skip-bad-records on load.** Decode arrays via `CloudPersistence.decodeArray` (whole-array first, then element-by-element), so one unreadable record can't wipe the whole file.
3. **Regression test.** Add a test that decodes an *old-schema* JSON (missing the new key) and asserts it loads with the field defaulted — not as an empty/failed decode.

Reference implementation: `Sources/Core/CloudLogging/CloudProjectStore.swift` + `CloudPersistence` + `CloudMigrationTests`.

## Single source of truth & reactive state (IMPORTANT)

State that more than one screen reads — device/link/capture status, discovery, connection health — lives in **one `@Observable @MainActor` owner**, and views render it. Don't scatter the same knowledge across views, and don't re-derive or re-validate it per screen. The recurring bug this prevents: three views each polling the same thing on a 1s timer, each with its own slightly-different copy of "is it connected?", so a fix in one place silently misses the others. Reference implementation: `CompanionRegistry` (the one source of truth for companion devices — discovery, gRPC links, CA push, capture heartbeats, the blocked-network hint), read by `AppModel`, `NetworkSession`, and every companion view.

Rules to follow when this kind of state shows up:

1. **One owner, many readers.** Put cross-cutting state in a single `@Observable` model and expose it (or a small derived view of it) to whoever needs it. New flows read the owner; they don't keep their own copy. A per-feature `FooModel` still owns its own area's state — this is about state that genuinely spans features.
2. **Reactive, never polled.** A view reads the observable property directly in its `body` (or via a computed that reads it), so SwiftUI re-renders the moment it changes — across object boundaries too (`session.companionLinked` → `registry.devices`). Reach for a `.task { while … sleep }` loop only for time itself (a clock, a timeout), never to discover state that's already observable. If you're writing a poll loop to read model state, the state is in the wrong place.
3. **Derive once, in the model.** Coarse display state (a `phase` enum, a "needs setup" flag) belongs on the model as a computed/struct field, not recomputed in each view. See `CompanionDeviceState.phase`.
4. **Callbacks flow inward, then stop.** Transport/services (`Core/`) surface raw events via closures to the one model that owns the domain; that model updates its observable state and the UI follows. Views don't subscribe to services directly, and services don't know about views.
5. **Clean layering still holds.** `Core/` (no SwiftUI: processes, sockets, parsing) → `Model/` (`@Observable` state + orchestration) → `Features/` (thin views). Keep pure logic in free functions/enums and unit-test it (per the Testability convention) rather than through the UI.

When you catch yourself adding the same `@State` + poll + validation to a second view, stop and lift that state into its shared owner instead.
